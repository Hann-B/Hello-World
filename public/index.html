    <h1>The Web, Now and Later.</h1>
    <p>
      In the beginning, simplicity was the only option. 
      The few acceptable input options yielded responses in a simple read format. 
      Years passed, design options expanded, yielding greater user capability. 
      Fast forward to today, web pages change form from desktop to tablet to mobile phone.

      I see the web developing into an interface that may be manipulated by the user through a 3D device. 
      The page may also be navigated through verbal commands in addition to physical. 
      For example, a button that read ‘Home’ may be clicked or voiced ‘Home’ to achieve the same destination.
      Eventually, the user will be able to use their eyes to navigate the interface!
